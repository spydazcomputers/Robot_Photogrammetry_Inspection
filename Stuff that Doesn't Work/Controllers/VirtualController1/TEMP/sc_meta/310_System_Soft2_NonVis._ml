            This part is mainly a help for the configurator.
            It specifies the direction of mapped signals which are
            not present anywhere else in the configuration.
            In particular it is necessary to specify signals with
            direction "input" as they cannot be mapped to the input
            area of a device or to an output of the safety app or
            to a CL Resultant.

            The FuncIOMappings must be declared previously.

            The system does not really use these signals in Soft Opmode,
            but they are defined and RobotStudio needs to know they are
            to remain. Set them as being written by the system so nobody
            else can modify them.
