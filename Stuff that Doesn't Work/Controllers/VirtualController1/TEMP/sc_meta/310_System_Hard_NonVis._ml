            This part is mainly a help for the configurator.
            It specifies the direction of mapped signals which are
            not present anywhere else in the configuration.
            In particular it is necessary to specify signals with
            direction "input" as they cannot be mapped to the input
            area of a device or to an output of the safety app or
            to a CL Resultant.

            The FuncIOMappings must be declared previously.
